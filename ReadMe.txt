-You'll need a version of Matlab with the Image Processing Toolbox installed. 
-The code was written in MATLAB 2013, and I know it runs in MATLAB 2016
-Extract Features is the main core function that does all the fancy stuff.
-MainISIC is for batch processing. 
-Main is an older batprocessing file (no need to look at it).


There's a tester script, Tester.m, that runs the function on one image. 
Use this and DON'T, I repeat DON'T, run Main or MainISIC unless you like your pc on fire.
